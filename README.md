    Deploying a highly available web app using AWS Cloudfront</h3>




### About the project

Deploying a highly available web app - Udagram  - an Instagram like web app
Udacity project demonstrating deploying a webapp using infrastructure as code on AWS Cloudformation.

#### Scenario
Your company is creating an Instagram clone called Udagram.

Developers want to deploy a new application to the AWS infrastructure.

You have been tasked with provisioning the required infrastructure and deploying a dummy application, along with the necessary supporting software.

This needs to be automated so that the infrastructure can be discarded as soon as the testing team finishes their tests and gathers their results.
